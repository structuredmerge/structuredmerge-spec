module TreeHaver
  # Registration-first utility for finding tree-sitter grammar shared libraries.
  #
  # GrammarFinder resolves tree-sitter grammars in a constrained order:
  #
  # 1. explicit environment override
  # 2. existing TreeHaver registration
  # 3. explicit extra paths
  # 4. tree_sitter_language_pack cache/provisioning
  #
  # This class is designed to be used by language-specific merge gems
  # without requiring TreeHaver to own parser- or grammar-specific policy.
  #
  # == Security Considerations
  #
  # Loading shared libraries is inherently dangerous as it executes arbitrary
  # native code. GrammarFinder performs the following security validations:
  #
  # - Language names are validated to contain only safe characters
  # - Paths from environment variables are validated before use
  # - Path traversal attempts (../) are rejected
  # - Only files with expected extensions (.so, .dylib, .dll) are accepted
  #
  # For additional security, use {#find_library_path_safe} which only returns
  # paths from trusted system directories.
  #
  # @example Basic usage
  #   finder = TreeHaver::GrammarFinder.new(:toml)
  #   path = finder.find_library_path
  #   # => "/home/user/.cache/tree-sitter-language-pack/vX/libs/libtree_sitter_toml.so"
  #
  # @example Check availability
  #   finder = TreeHaver::GrammarFinder.new(:json)
  #   if finder.available?
  #     language = TreeHaver::Language.load(finder.language_name, finder.find_library_path)
  #   end
  #
  # @example Register with TreeHaver
  #   finder = TreeHaver::GrammarFinder.new(:bash)
  #   finder.register! if finder.available?
  #   # Now you can use: TreeHaver::Language.bash
  #
  # @example With custom search paths
  #   finder = TreeHaver::GrammarFinder.new(:toml, extra_paths: ["/opt/custom/lib"])
  #
  # @example Secure mode (trusted directories only)
  #   finder = TreeHaver::GrammarFinder.new(:toml)
  #   path = finder.find_library_path_safe  # Only returns paths in trusted dirs
  #
  # @see PathValidator For details on security validations
