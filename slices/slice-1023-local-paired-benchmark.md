# Slice 1023: Local paired benchmark and curated corpus

## Status and scope

This slice adds an executable, offline companion to Slice 1022 without changing
`structuredmerge.benchmark/v1`. The canonical corpus is
`diagnostics/slice-1023-local-paired-benchmark/corpus.json`. Its cases use the
Slice 1022 case vocabulary; the corpus envelope adds selection profiles,
provider selectors, changed-path capability mapping, and deterministic expected
summaries. All source is inline, project-authored CC0-1.0 material.

The first runner belongs in `ast-merge-git`: it is the package that can invoke
both the real `git merge-file` executable and the installed StructuredMerge Git
driver with equivalent role bytes and a preserved working directory.

## Corpus and admission

The corpus is stratified across JSON, JSONC, JSON5, Ruby/Prism, YAML, TOML,
Markdown, HTML, Bash, and TypeScript. `sentinel`, `gold`, and `metamorphic`
partitions cover independent edits, intentional ownership conflicts,
delete/modify, duplicate identity, preservation, malformed selected revisions,
and deterministic reorder/format/comment transformations.

Every inline input and expected output has an exact SHA-256 digest. Every case
records independent edit IDs, expected conflict regions, oracle procedure or
artifact, acceptable equivalence, preservation policy, false-auto-merge
severity, and reviewed authorship/license provenance. Parse acceptance alone is
never semantic equivalence. Ambiguous admission is excluded rather than guessed.

## Profiles and deterministic selection

`micro` is exactly the mandatory clean, conflict, and malformed sentinels.
`dev` is the union, in canonical case order, of:

1. mandatory sentinels;
2. every case directly mapped from changed paths through the corpus capability
   map; and
3. a bounded deterministic neighbor sample from the remaining cases.

`nightly` selects the complete admitted corpus without external competitors.
`competitive` selects the complete admitted corpus and enables only explicitly
configured, pinned competitor adapters. A profile therefore declares both its
selection mode (`sentinels`, `affected`, or `all`) and competitor policy
(`none` or `configured`); providing a competitor executable outside the
`competitive` profile is an error rather than an implicit sweep.

Neighbor order is SHA-256 of `seed + NUL + case_id`, then case ID. Selection
reports every changed path, inferred capability, direct case, sentinel, neighbor
population, ordering algorithm, seed, selected ID, exclusion, and unsupported
operation. `merge2`, `merge3`, and `metamorphic` are executable; `diff` remains
selection-only. Budgets are explicit and are never silently extended.

## Paired execution and classification

Each selected case is materialized beneath the gem-local `tmp/` directory.
For `merge2`, the runner compares an explicitly named `template.overwrite`
baseline with the selected provider's `merge2(incoming, current)` operation.
The overwrite baseline returns the exact incoming bytes and intentionally
demonstrates loss of current-owned content; it is not represented as Git or as
a structural merge tool.

For `merge3`, the runner executes `git merge-file -p ours base theirs`, then
the installed `ast-merge-git` executable with the case's exact provider
selector. The candidate process runs from the materialized Git working
directory and the runner proves that its own cwd is unchanged.

For `metamorphic`, the baseline is `git diff --no-index` over the exact authored
source and transformed bytes. The candidate is the selected installed
provider's `diff2` operation. A shared invariant oracle separately verifies
JSON-family semantic equality and JSONC AST comment retention; adapter output
determines whether semantic edit units were emitted. The initial reorder,
formatting, and comment transformations require no semantic edit. Git's
non-empty textual edits are therefore false conflicts, while empty provider
changes are correct clean results. Generator identity, version, seed,
transformation IDs, and verified authored-byte digests remain in each result.

Raw records retain status, stdout, stderr, selected output, byte length,
SHA-256, diagnostics, conflict regions, exact and structural checks,
independent-edit evidence, provenance, and runtime as separate fields.
`diff` cases are selection-only until a correct installed adapter exists and
are reported `unsupported`, reducing coverage only.

Outcomes are the Slice 1022 matrix: `correct_clean`, `false_conflict`,
`true_conflict`, `false_auto_merge`, `error`, `unsupported`, and
`excluded_ambiguous`. A clean result where conflict is required is always
`false_auto_merge`; parse validity, formatting, speed, and other successes
cannot compensate. A categorized rejection of an input whose oracle expects a
parse error is `correct_clean`; an uncategorized process failure remains
`error`. Semantic equivalence and source preservation are evaluated
independently, so preservation failures do not masquerade as false
auto-merges.

## Report and cache identity

Paired reports keep safety, effectiveness, preservation, performance,
reliability, and coverage distinct. They stratify by operation, partition,
family, provider, dialect, capability, severity, and transition, and enumerate
newly passing, newly failing, and changed-conflict cases. No scalar score exists.

The cache identity hashes the adapter executable, selector/configuration,
canonical corpus bytes, profile and selection, and normalized environment
identity. No persistent cache is introduced. A deterministic rerun compares
correctness records with runtime removed; runtime is never used to vote on
correctness.

Cold correctness runs may distribute independent cases across 1-32 worker
processes. The requested count, actual worker PIDs, and deterministic
corpus-order reduction are run evidence. A separate binary-safe JSONL adapter
serves repeated operations from one long-lived Ruby process for performance
measurement only. Persistent-process output is never assigned a correctness
classification and cannot alter a correctness gate.

## Family CI calibration

The Ruby family CI executes the `dev` profile on every push and pull request.
It derives repeatable `--changed-path` inputs from the merge-base range, so
capability selection, sentinels, and deterministic neighbors use the same
algorithm as local development. A separate lock pins the benchmark corpus
repository, full revision, and corpus path; CI verifies the detached checkout
before execution.

The aggregate JSON report is retained as a CI artifact and a concise
non-scalar summary is written to the job summary. CI fails for unexpected
candidate runner errors or timeouts, the non-compensable candidate
false-auto-merge gate, or a candidate preservation violation or unverified
required preservation property.
Performance observations, competitor outcomes, unsupported coverage, and
aggregate effectiveness counts do not independently gate during calibration.
This `dev` execution establishes stable artifact and variance history before a
larger `pr` profile or any Azure orchestration is admitted.

The initial executable metamorphic pair is deterministic: both Git textual
baselines are false conflicts and both StructuredMerge provider diffs are
correct clean results. This is development evidence only; it does not authorize
an aggregate quality claim.

## Pinned structural competitor

The corpus pins Mergiraf source revision
`13b813c02da9511c7433131aed142473ffe62d52`, version `0.18.0`, GPL-3.0-only
reference-only reuse posture, Rust 1.91.0 toolchain, build command, merge3-only
operation coverage, and supported dialects. Competitive execution is optional,
requires the `competitive` profile and an explicit `--mergiraf PATH`; no binary
or vendor source is embedded in the corpus.

The runner verifies the reported version, records the binary SHA-256 and path,
executes the same exact base/ours/theirs bytes with bounded child-process
handling, and evaluates output with the same oracle and preservation checks.
Unsupported operations and dialects are coverage, not quality failures.
Competitor false auto-merges are surfaced separately and never alter the
StructuredMerge candidate safety gate.

At the pinned revision, built from the tracked source with Rust 1.91.0, the
10-case JSON-affected dev selection produced two `correct_clean`, two
`true_conflict`, one `false_conflict`, one `false_auto_merge`, and four
`unsupported` Mergiraf results. The false auto-merge is the reviewed duplicate
JSON identity case; this is a non-compensable competitor safety finding, not a
ranking or aggregate quality claim.

## CLI

`ast-merge-git benchmark validate|select|run|report|performance --corpus PATH`
emits JSON. Selection commands accept
`--profile micro|dev|nightly|competitive` and repeatable `--changed-path PATH`.
`run` and `report` accept an installed `--driver`, `--workers COUNT`, and an
optional pinned `--mergiraf PATH` under `competitive`. `performance` accepts
`--iterations COUNT` and emits performance evidence without quality
classification. Network and external services are denied by contract.
